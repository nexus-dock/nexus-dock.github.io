## Display

### How-to

You can display a Nexus instance even if you don’t have one yourself.  
It only requires to **copy / paste a code snippet** inside the `body` tags of an html page.

### Ready-made snippets

When you visit a Nexus, look for this **symbol**: `</>`; click to expand.  
The html snippet contains `div` and `script` tags.  
Copy / paste its content in your page and voilà!

### Custom-made snippets

For examples and attributes overview, check the snippet [documentation](/docs/snippet).

### Clear cache

If a thread has not yet been visited, or if its content has been updated since your last visit, its link will be followed by an asterisk `*`.

To reset hints, you can clear your browser cache, or just the **app cache**.  
In your browser address bar, add `?clear` to the current url.  
If a query string is already present, use `&clear` instead.

### In WordPress

Edit the blog post or page where you want to display the Nexus.  
Add a new code block.  
Paste the code snippet in the text area of the block.
