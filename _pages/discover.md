## Discover

### Set Paths

A Nexus instance has 1 author and up to 100 threads.  
We lead many lives. Each thread can be dedicated to one of those.

### Focus on Quality

A thread has only 1 local content.  
Make that single content worthwhile and up to date instead of piling archives.  
No infinite scroll.  
No stressing out about what you may have written two years ago.

### Connect and Explore

A thread can be connected up to 100 other Nexus instances.  
Curate what will go along with your content.  
Follow links from one Nexus instance to the next.

### Own your Data

There is no central platform.  
Down to the core, a Nexus instance is simply structured text data, contained in a single file.  
It can be hosted anywhere, as long as the server allows for external requests.

### Run it Everywhere

The Nexus App is hosted on a Content Delivery Network and runs in-browser.  
It can be embedded in any html page.

### Shapeshift Anything

This project is open source.  
Only the protocol shall remain.  
The Nexus app is themable, forkable, replaceable.
